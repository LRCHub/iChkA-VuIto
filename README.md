```
I hope you doin' fine
I know we had our problems,
but never mind
I just wanna say that,
that I'm sorry after all
this time
I know things change,
but every single song
still feels like you
I never knew pain until the
day I didn't look back
when I left you
And I know, I know,
I know that you don't
wanna hear it
But you know, you know, you know,
you know, you know that
The best times of my life
Were the ones that had you
I had to bury them inside
To get me through
I hope you doin' fine
I know we had our problems,
but whatever
I've been broken for some
time now
And I'm just pullin' myself
back together
I got rid of everything
that smells like you
(Before the summer, so)
I can spend time
thinkin' 'bout somebody
other than you
(While I recover, hm)
And I know, I know,
I know that you don't
wanna hear it
(You don't want to hear)
But you know, you know, you know,
you know, you know that
(Yeah, you know)
The best times of my life
(Times of my life)
Were the ones that had you
(Were the ones that had you)
I had to bury them inside
(Bury them inside)
To get me through
(To get me through)
The best times of my life
(Times of my life)
Were the ones with you, yeah,
yeah
I hope you are fine knowing
you hold all my best times, and
Without you, I'm lying to myself,
saying that you'll come find me
I hope you are fine knowing
you hold all my best times, and
Without you, I'm lying to myself,
saying that you'll come find me
